Comfort Suites Johnson Creek Conference Center,"₹7,172",840 reviews,4.1,"725 Paradise Ln, Johnson Creek, WI 53038, United States",+1 920-699-2800,https://www.choicehotels.com/wisconsin/johnson-creek/comfort-suites-hotels/wi127?mc=llgoxxpx,Aug 29 - 30,3:00 PM,11:00 AM,Comfort Suites Johnson Creek Conference Center,"₹6,804",Alissa Cotter,"We stayed at this hotel last weekend for a softball tournament. We had stay there last year as well. This year the service was disappointing. There is a beautiful patio area in the back but no one could use it because the outside gate key lock was broken. They would not allow access to the patio from the breakfast room. We had a grandparent of one of our players wanting to sit outside to read a book before an afternoon game and her best option was on a picnic table on the side of the building. We asked if she could sit on the patio in more comfortable chairs and the front desk person told us the only way she could get to the patio was if we hoisted her over the fence. Not very feasible for an elderly person. The previous year we stayed at the hotel, the patio was accessible and we spent a lot of time out there. This year the staff was not interested in accommodating our group using a patio that was intentionally built to allow paying guests to use. Because our group was not allowed on the patio, we asked if we could sit in the breakfast room and again, we were told we could not access that space. We will be looking for alternative hotels in that area next summer when our group of 30 needs a place to stay for a tournament.",4,1,4,3.6,4,3.9,3.7

,,,,,,,,,,Booketta,"₹6,381",Lacey Mattsen,"Mediocre at best. And this below isn't even the half of it. We stayed in the beginning of June 2024.Nearly every single trash can that we encountered in the public areas of the hotel was very full. We did witness the one right outside in front of the lobby being changed Saturday morning. But I do remember on Saturday afternoon, the one by the conference center being very full and not attended to.Saturday morning, someone had their cats in the breakfast area. There were people in our group that are highly allergic to cats. This was all in addition to disgusting tables and messy serving area. We (2 families, not just my family) witnessed a hotel worker walk in, check to see how much food was gone and walk away. She did not replace the napkins (there were none left), she didn't care about the spilled milk on the floor. She didn't seem to care about the disgusting state of the breakfast area at all.Apparently, our block of rooms was overbooked. Our softball coaches did not have a room available to them even though they reserved one. A parent and a player got the last room. Even though their reservations were from March.And to elaborate on a few things, it was raining very hard on Saturday. The parking situation is very poor at this hotel. Our room was near the middle/lobby of the hotel. We ended up having to park way down near the conference center. I got my key card out expecting to have to buzz in but the doors at the conference center were unlocked. We got all the way up to our room on the 3rd floor - without using a key.The trash near the pool - it was on the outside of the building, near the pool equipment. It was outside of the emergency door.... In plain view of people swimming in the pool area.I do have to say, the poor woman that was working Saturday night.... Bless her heart. She was very kind even though she was clearly very irritated with the rude, rowdy and messy kids from Illinois who weren't being controlled by their annebrated parents. (She honestly should have evicted the from the hotel because they were very loud and disturbed everyone!)The workers at check in and check out were also pleasant and made the process fast and simple.Our room was large, clean and comfortable.... Which this family of 4 appreciated.",2,1,3,,,,

Hot tub was out of order when we arrived, I called to check to make sure it was back up before driving back this evening and was assured it was up. I found it full of sand only to be told by the front desk attendant(Miranda) that the sand was normal even after showing her these photos. Seriously, stay anywhere else. Also, no towels available at the pool and no waffles and no OJ at breakfast.",1,1,1,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,Stayforless,"₹6,381",Shelby Bowles,Was told they had a pool & hot tub. Get there and it's closed. Reassured that it would be open tomorrow. Closed. Asked for a cancellation so we could go somewhere that has an open hot tub - they said they can cancel it but the cancellation fee will be the same price as the room. Only reason I stayed here is because I wanted a hotel with a hot tub after driving 9 hours. Terrible customer service.,2,1,3,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,PrimaStay,"₹6,381",Jodi Adie,"Only thing that this hotel could have going for it is the pool. Great set up for kids, unfortunately the water is too cool and the hot tub is never hot.Hot water in the room was hit and miss, mostly miss.The wifi is completely useless unless you are on the first floor and even then it’s not great.They say your room will be cleaned after the third night, was here for six nights and never even seen a sign of housekeeping. Had to ask for clean towels and coffee.The coffee station in the lobby, I don’t think had the cream and sugars replaced all week. Basket sat empty for two days.The place was quiet all week but on the weekend the noise blows up with the kids running through the halls. Which I could over look given the pool area and being popular for families, if not for all the other problems.Price is cheap, I guess you get what you pay for.Never was a person at the desk, when needing assistance, always had to use the phone to call for assistance",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,GoSplitty,"₹6,803",Shannon Schuster,"We had stayed here for a family vacation and booked 3 rooms for 4 nights. The hotel is older and not so kept up. The kiddy pool was really cool but the water is freezing, the floor in the kiddy pad is so slippy as it has no grit and everyone kept falling and the jacuzzi out of order. So that was really unsafe and disappointing. The room itself were okay. The customer service is seriously lacking. Housekeeping is supposed to come on your 3rd night of stay to help get trash, give clean towls and change bedding and we knew this because we called our 2nd night asking when Housekeeping should come by and the front desk agent said only on the 3rd day but they never came the 3rd day. We complained regarding this because we had no towls and the front desk agent stated that they had no clean towls to give because everything was dirty and she told us to call her back around 9pm to see if there were any towls to get and that she couldnt bring them to the room we would have to come get them from the desk. The front desk agent said Housekeeping and managers only work during the mornings and that she's only worked there for 2 months and is by herself working at night and doesn't have any authority to handle the situation. My family and I will not be using this location again.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,Holisto,"₹6,803",Jenna Lee,I stayed for three nights and requested early breakfast to go upon check in. I was told that it is up to the person in the kitchen. I went at 550 am. I asked the lady in the kitchen if I could grab some food and she opened the breakfast doors early for me on the morning of June 11 and 12. The lady was nice enough to let me grab some food because I work at 630am. On June 13 I went and asked a new lady working in the kitchen if I could grab some fruit and  yogurt or toast before heading off to work and she said no. She was rude and when I asked if I could just have some fruit she  rudely told me no. The service is extremely poor and the staff are unhelpful. This hotel needs major improvement on customer service. I have traveled in healthcare for the last nine years and stayed at many hotels and this has never been an issue. I canceled my reservation for next week and will not be staying here again.,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,Expedia.co.in,"₹7,202",Kristain Schutt,"This is an absolutely horrible hotel. Not only do they not clean their rooms or change the bedding after each guest leaves, they decide to accuse guests of using derogatory language towards staff when that was never the case with multiple witnesses telling the general manager that it never happened.The first night, we arrived late after flying all day to meet up with our family at this hotel. When we went to get into bed and pulled back the sheets, there was a significant amount of blood on the sheet. Not like run through the wash blood, but like the previous guest had a bloody nose and they never changed the sheets.Then, the next morning, my husband had to deal with the extremely unprofessional general manager. Instead of ""investigating"" the incident, he chose to pick out my husband because he had a bald head and green shirt with tattoos. The ironic thing was he wasn't the only bald headed man with a green shirt and tattoos. My husband asked the manager if he wanted us to leave, but the manager never asked us to. After the night before and that morning, our family was done. We had 6 rooms due to being their for a family death, and we all left because we felt unsafe and unwelcome. My husband and I made sure to record the room when we left because we were afraid that damage to the room would be done and blamed on us.So, if you want blood-stained sheets, filthy rooms, an unprofessional general manager, and an experience from hell, this would be your place to go.",1,3,4,,,,

The hot tub, kiddie pool and main pool are all pretty good sized (sometimes pics online can be deceiving) so it was never too crowded. Considering breakfast is free, that was phenomenal too. Hot and cold options that were constantly stocked and super friendly staff. The rooms won’t blow your mind or anything, but with 2 adults, 3 kids and a dog it had everything we needed and was spacious enough. Every staff member we encountered was polite and ensured our stay was enjoyable.

Here is my  issue,  I left Saturday morning, put a ""do not  disturb"" sign on the door,  came back Saturday afternoon,  and all my personal items were scattered all around the room went to complain,  I was told that they made a mistake and that they cleaned my room. Went back up and discovered that the refreshments I had purchased were missing, and the garage had not been empty.  And they supposedly cleaned my room.  I went back down, and they were in the office.  My point is that all my stuff was in my room and a phone call should be made to front desk . And then my personal property should not have been touched.  When my family and I packed room to leave checked every nook and cranny, discovered a blue moon ice cream stuck in the freezer.  It was not ours.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,Metessa Burzynski,"I stayed at this hotel in May of 2023, my 1st room had lots of hair when pulling back the sheets. Staff were quick to get me a different room, after being locked out of my room the 2nd night I found out they ultimately put me in a room that was not to be rented out due to it ""needing a deep clean"". It definitely did, it was not very clean at all.Next stay July 2023, on my 2nd day, my hot water was not working and the tub and sink drain was not draining, I let front desk know and they stated it would be repaired within the 8 hours I would be gone. I returned to the problem not fixed, and I don't think it was even addressed. After speaking with the front desk I was put into a different room, supposedly the last available room. This room was utterly disgusting. There was hair and stains in the bed, toenail clippings and other debris on the floor, a thick layer of dust, hair, and grime on not common surfaces, the PTAC unit was full of dust, dirt, and grime as well, the couch was full of various colored stains. I was given clean sheets for the night. When talking to William Miller, the General Manager, he disregarded the hot water issue stating, ""well that isn't a quick fix, so yeah it wasn't fixed, they should have put you in a different room."" When I told him about the condition of the 2nd room, he was not very apologetic and didn't seem to validate the concerns at all. He stated he would refund my stay, but didn't, I had to call again to request it, and he never returned my call. I can definitely see why his building is in the condition it is in.On my way out, I used a side door, it was not locked, and the security lock keypad was dismantled, making the door accessible to anyone. I see from previous google reviews, this has been a problem for a few months now. I will not be staying here again.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,Jordan Z,"Comfort suites allows anyone to come in and swim in their lovely indoor pool for $5 a head. Recently our family has made it a weekly thing to come here to swim with our kid for an hour or so, and it's a blast, they even have a toddler play pool playground thing. We must have been quite the nuisance though because they started to turn us away at the door saying they do not allow swimming if the hotel is past 50% capacity. I understand rules are rules however this rule simply did not exist for the past couple months. In fact on several occasions we have paid to go swimming while watching people being sent to other hotels as they have no more space. It's never been a problem as the hotel is somewhat business oriented and no one uses the pool. But for one reason or another they have started to enforce this rule in quite a cold shoulder fashion. Our three year old as you can imagine, is not impressed and neither are we. Great hotel with a couple nice employees, just don't cross paths with the manager, as she will most certainly make sure you know of her power as a manager if she so pleases. I will avoid this hotel because of the manager and the manager only.Edit- not sure why the review says it was posted 4 weeks ago, I posted this (as it says above) when my child was 3, he's 7 now. No worries on the closed pool, I assume that's what it is at every hotel/motel at this point in time. I do appreciate the reply, I'll bump my review from 3 to 4 stars, as the review was mainly reflecting on an employee at the time the review was actually posted.",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,Kayla Powell,"The room was pretty nice, bed was comfortable. The biggest issue with the stay was that at 2am the fire alarms started going off. A handful of patrons started our way off of our floor and down through the exits while smelling an extremely strong burning smell on the left, back half of the building. When we arrived to the lobby area, we were told by your male employee that it was a false alarm and that it had been tripped and it took a few of us telling him that there was a strong fire smell as we came down before he took it somewhat seriously. The fire department did not come until 20 minutes or more AFTER the alarms were turned off. The man from the desk and a fire/emt man went up to walk the halls to attempt to find the source and were telling us that it was an external heater that just ""got too hot"". None of the staff were going around, checking on the patrons nor did they seem to think that there should need to be any sort of quick response to a possible extreme emergency happening in this place. Heaven forbid there had been a full force fire/emergency that could've cost lives/damages. This event was very poorly handled and then to tell the patrons to go back to bed, not worry about it unless the alarms go off again, then to go back to the lobby area. Please train your employees better as to how to handle these situations.",,,,,,,

We wanted purple and when we got there it was blue. I understand that mistakes can be made and things don't always work out due to poor communication or other factors, but we paid extra for this and the color wasn't what we had talked about. But other than the uplighting mistake, everything else was perfectly done and our guests had a great time. I come here to swim too and always enjoy the hot tub. All the employees are friendly and accommodating. Steven at the front desk was helpful and Tara our event coordinator was amazing, very good with getting back to me about things and met with me several times to make sure everything was how we wanted it.

From lack of organization for having multiple wedding blocks in one weekend to dirty rooms it was consistently bad.

They were told to get ready in the pool locker room, which obviously was very wet and not ideal for getting ready to attend a wedding. Luckily the people we were sharing a room with let them into ours to get ready, otherwise they would have had to use the car to change. When my dad called to check on the status of his room during the wedding they we’re told it was ready but could not be given a room number & then when they got back after the wedding to check in no one seemed to know what they were doing.

When looking for a kid friendly hotel your  looking for safety, cleanliness, space, and fun active areas where your children can play safely. Along with free wi-fi, free breakfast, workout room, laundry room, 3 pools, convention rooms, I feel that this Comfort Suites has it all. Checking in was easy and fast. The friendly staff made me feel comfortable and at ease when thinking about this virus. They have antibacterial disinfectant all over the hotel and are up to code with the facial mask rules.

Her only response was that the front deck person shouldn't have let us in.We asked for a refund since we had planned on spending longer at the pool and she did agree to that, yet was very rude when we came to the deck to get it.I feel an apology would have gone along was in this situation.Along with signs at the deck and pool door that the area was only going to be open until 2pm.We like to use hotels for paid day use of their pools in the winter, unfortunately this will not be one that we return to.",,,,,,,

We LOVED the size of the rooms and the pool. The rooms have plenty of space and a large fridge (compared to other hotels). Breakfast was sufficient and while it's not directly off the highway, it's close to lots of shopping and eating.The unfortunate part of our stay revolved around the cleanliness and ""repair"" of the place. Our bathroom wasn't clean when we checked in (Hair on toilet) and many things were ""Out of Order"" - Ice Machine, Kiddie pool, soda machine, one elevator, etc. Although management finally rectified them, the service we received after raising some concerns was sub par. Clerks seemed ""on edge"" and unwilling to resolve some of the issues we had. Customer service is everything and had this hotel made just a bit of an effort to respond to some simple concerns our stay would have been a 3.5-4 star stay. This stay was a 2-2.5 star experience for us.In spite of all that, I would recommend this hotel. However, second chances are rare with me and if the same thing happened again it would demonstrate that there are deeper issues than simply catching the staff on a busy weekend.",,,,,,,

Arrive the night before her wedding to be told another member of my family cancelled my room when in reality the family member did cancel a room but this hotel cancelled their room as well as MY room on an obvious error and they flat out refused to except responsibility for this mistake even as all of us stood in in person at the reception desk stating our cases. Despite the fact the we are all very understanding people the whole situation escalated and I was so embarrassed and upset!!!! I had a confirmation email but NEVER received a cancellation email nor could they show me that one was ever sent to me but just a flat out refusal to except responsibility! No apologies we given. We were told that if a room opened up next night, the night of the wedding, we would be first for the room. The next day at the wedding my aunt said they booked her for two rooms but she only booked one but no one called to tell us there was a room available! I had to call and tell them I knew a cancellation was made by my aunt and was expecting a room which we did get in the end but had to handle on my own during my daughters wedding ... where I was going to sleep that night should not have been a worry!!! The next morning at breakfast we discovered we were billed for 3 stays when we only stayed 2! Family of the groom was billed for 4 stays when it was suppose to be 2 as well. My sisters-in-law has to dress in her car because they arrived at the scheduled check in time at 3:00 the day of the wedding and their room was not ready. All the fitness equipped in the workout room either was out of service or rickety, and that's if you could even get into it. ... Save yourself the headache and stay somewhere else.

I spoke to a number of servers and bartenders during the evening and was always greeted with a smile and pleasant conversation. They were extremely efficient, accommodating and helpful. I know that putting together a group of people like this is not an easy task. Event planning takes a special person who is dedicated to creating the best possible day for her clients and Christine is certainly that person!

Should also probably update your website breakfast isn’t cereal and instant oatmeal. Our room was filthy! Garbage sitting on the table and under the tv stand. The first night the pool was about 35 degrees I was pleasantly surprised to find it warm enough to swim in the next morning.,5,5,5,,,,

I ending up getting info about a taxi company from the grocery store instead.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,Michael Jacobson,Everytime I have to come here this place disappoints me more and more. The rooms always look like they never get cleaned well after each guest. The staff here are the worst part of the stay. Besides the girl at checkout today she was very kind and professional. I watched her bust her butt trying to get everyone's breakfast and the manager just stood around and didn't decide to help her. They definitely need more people like her working there.,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,Dave Immel,"I would have given the facility a lower rating however the staff earned an upgrade.  As a business manager, I’m aware that many people only write reviews when they are unhappy about something, be it real or perceived.  I try to write about the positive whenever possible too.I’m also aware that  some things are not within the control of the employees and should be directed to the property owners.  So, lets start there.  The hotel was generally clean.  It appeared that the carpeting throughout was fairly new but showing use.  In terms of our room, it had a whirlpool tub sitting in the ‘living room’ which we never intended  to use.  It was dated, showing it’s age and the tile around it could have used new grout, especially on the floor along the base of the tub.The couch fabric was pilling and I’d hate to point a black light at it.  There wasn’t an end table or coffee table in the room so there was no where to place a drink.  Please consider changing this soon.So, let’s talk about the bathroom sink.  We found that it was totally clogged and wouldn’t drain.  My wife and I were in a hurry to start our day so we left without informing the staff…shame on us.  In any event, we returned to our room around 3:00 at which time I called the front desk to tell them about the sink.  To my surprise, the woman on the phone told me she would come up and see what she could do to fix it.  I expected them to call maintenance or something…I guess.When she arrived I found out the woman trying to fix our clogged sink was in fact the General Manager of the hotel; Christine Aumueller, working on her day off.  She told us her maintenance man had left for the day and she would do what she could.  After working on the sink for quite awhile, she said that maintenance would have to repair it on Monday and offered to move us to another room.  My wife and I decided to stay in this room and agreed to work around the non-draining sink.  Christine was very personable and accommodating, doing what she could to make things right.A couple other five star worthy highlights were again the staff.  The young lady at the front desk was extremely friendly.  The two women who attended to the complementary breakfast were attentive and made sure everything was freshly stocked throughout our time in the room.All in all, we would recommend this comfort suites and would urge ownership to consider updating more than carpeting.",,,,,,,

It had a shallow kids area with a double slide, a large pool with 3 basketball hoops, and a nice sized hot tub. It was so much more than expected. Warm water in all pools and great temp in hot tub. The only reason I didnt give it a 5 star is because bathrooms were freezing cold and the air outside in the pool area was a little cold for my taste... however that might be because we came on a -25 degree day lol. Will go to this place lots more hidden gem",,,,,,,

Another guest at the front desk said they had bed bugs.  The front desk staff did not seem to care too much and the manager of the hotel was no where to be found.    They did give us half off our room but only because I was not happy with the cleanliness.",,,,,,,

The toilet didn't flush properly and the room was not clean. Second they overcharged me twice and try to blame a company credit card that didn't work. I have been waiting for 8 days and still no refund. The general manager thinks it's ok to blame everyone else then his staff or business. I didn't authorize you to charge my credit card for over $500 in unauthorized charges. This is fraud! Beware when staying here.,5,5,5,,,,

Very close to the outlet mall for all youe needs. Along with gas station open 24hrs down the road as well. This is a great place to stop if your traveling i94 and need to take a rest in between your trips. Truck drivers are welcomed. They also have the ability for you to rent a room for all your businesses company needs.,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,Ashley H,The only plus side about this place was the free breakfast in the morning. Most the time the internet didnt work so I could not pull up my work assignments. The hot tub was down for 3 1/2 weeks and occasionally I would find the door to my room open! They do not salt their sidewalks in winter right away when they should as well as plowing the parking lot. A bit of the staff was friendly I can say that for them.,,,,,,,

The room was clean, but I think something was wrong with the heater.  It became very hot in the middle of the night.  The only real drawback was that there weren't a lot of delivery places nearby, but a Pizza Hut was 5 to 10 minutes from the hotel.  It was a little too far away to deliver.  Otherwise,  the hotel had frozen pizzas for $10 and they would cook it for you.",,,,,,,

There is a very poor (practically zero) WiFi signal at the room, very slow and small connectivity at the lobby. I was asking/begging for them to do something - and they don't really care.

Employee couldnt quite the rate for the wedding so she had to book it for a higher rate. I asked if i could cancel at anytime she said yes. I got a email 1 day before the wedding and i was charged the higher rate of $199 plus tax I called hotel to try to get some answers or cancell. All they said they could do was investigate the case  they also called me sir! They also said i couldn't cancel. What a mess! Not happy with this hotel management or they way they handled this. I might be out $235.00 but if they do their investigation of listening to recorded phone call of my reservation they should clearly see what this employee did wrong & give me my $$ back!,,,,,,,

Large amount of hair left on shower wall. 3. White dental bands left in several places on room floor. 4. Front desk could not give us answers.,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,Erin Kelly,"Having stayed in several ""pet-friendly"" hotels, I am appalled by our visit to Comfort Suites Johnson Creek. After attending a wedding, my husband and I arrived back to the room to find that our dog, who was crated, had been removed. In his place was a note stating he was barking too much and had been moved to the front office area. We did not receive any calls throughout the night to inform us of barking problems or the decision to enter our room and relocate our most important property - our dog.  I would rather have been notified of the problem, in which case I would have left the wedding early, as opposed to having my dog taken from our room by strangers and stored in an unfamiliar area for hours. Never before have we encountered this type of ""pet-friendliness"". This hotel has no written or published policy stating dogs who bark will be removed from rooms, unbeknownst to their owners. If I had seen that written in a policy, I wouldn't have put my dog through this trauma.",,,,,,,

The receptionist was unenthused and told me the the person in charge wasn't there. I asked if she knew when return would return or if there was a better time to call to which I got a real short, ""I don't know"". Then I asked if I could leave a voicemail with them to which she quite literally huffed at and transferred me to a voicemail that was full. When I called back the next day, I got the same snooty receptionist which she had an even worse attitude that day. Needless to say, I still haven't been able to speak with anyone about a wedding reception rental.",,,,,,,

EVERY time they said they would call us back to discuss and set up the block for our needs. We NEVER received any phone calls back, mind you we have called 10 times over the course of about 3 weeks. They either push us off and say they will call back and never do, or no one answers in the first place. Absolutely ridiculous!",,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,Haylie Sprecher,"Working with this hotel for a block for a wedding was absolutely the worst part of wedding planning. It was a nightmare. From the beginning I was told something different t every single time I called - beginning with not being able to accommodate as many guests as we would have, only to call back and be told that there were “so many open rooms for that weekend”. My guests were repeatedly told the block was closed and were not offered another room even though there were open rooms. The management threw their employees under the bus repeatedly, telling me to “contact so-and-so instead of the front desk because they don’t know what their doing”. After thinking we had things under control, I call back only to find that the person I was working with “was no longer with them”. I was told by on sales person that we would have a gift opening room on 10/14 free of charge due to all of the frustration we were going through - only to have no one on staff know about this room and be led around the hotel 4 different times for “our” room. After getting set up we had another group come and tell us that it was their room, then we were led around the hotel again being told we didn’t have a room and we’re given a dirty conference room from the day before. Complete nightmare and an embarrassment for the bride and groom. I will never stay at a comfort suites ever again. Also, when we arrived at the front desk, we were not acknowledged by the front desk staff until she finished her phone call and looked at us and uttered “what’s up?” Completely unprofessional.",,,,,,,

How much is a regular room for that night?[Employee] I don't know, I'd have to look.[Me] ...[Employee] ...[Me] Will you please look?[Employee] Yeah sure, it appears to be about $10 more than the block of rooms.[Me] Ok, I think I'll talk to the groom and book through the website.[Employee] -Hangs up-[Me] Hello?...

French vanilla and more creams for the coffee and in others they don't put anything 🤷🏽‍♀️ I loved that they put enough large towels in the room, extra blankets and pillows without asking for them. I simply loved it and would stay here again for several days 😁(Original)Me gustó mucho, he estado en varios hoteles y este ha superado mis expectativas.A mis hijos les fascinó la piscina, tienen café disponible todo el tiempo, y en el cuarto café y te el suficiente y en otros hoteles solo para 2 porciones.
